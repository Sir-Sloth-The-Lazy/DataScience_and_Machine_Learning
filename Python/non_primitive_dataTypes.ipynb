    "\n",
    "In Python, non-primitive data types (often called Data Structures or Collection Types) are objects that can store multiple values. Unlike primitive types (integers, floats, strings, booleans) which hold a single piece of data, non-primitive types are used to organize and group data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, everything is an object, but these types are specifically designed for data containment.\n"
