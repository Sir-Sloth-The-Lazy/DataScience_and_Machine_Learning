It calculates a unique \"fingerprint\" (hash) for every item you put inside it.Immutability is key: For a hash to stay valid, the item must be immutable (unchangeable). If you could change an item after it was put in a set, its \"fingerprint\" would change, and the set would \"lose\" the item.Lists are Mutable: Because you can change a list (add, remove, or modify elements), its hash value would change constantly. Therefore, Python considers lists \"unhashable.\""
